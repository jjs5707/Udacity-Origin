Udacity Git Hub Lesson 2

Reflection:
Prompt: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Response: If I was sharing my work with others or if I was planning on working on the project from more than one location. 

Activity: 
I'm editing this file on line :). Hopefully I can pull these changes successfully. This will be a fun way to work on projects no matter where I am located. How exciting!!
